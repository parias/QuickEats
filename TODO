# 1) If no Cart, need to alert empty cart
   # - at the current moment it is showing Chinese characters (probably object representation)
   - Clear Cart Button functionality

2) Order
   #- List of entrees
   # - Quantity 
   - If order has list of entrees, shows it as a list
      ex: ['wings', 'pizza', 'ranch']   
   #- For Chauffeur, add Address column
   #- Need Address for Anonymous Ordering
   #   solved by not letting not logged in users pay/order, redirects to login
   #
#@ Need to Have Separate Logins
   # - Buddy Adding Menu Items
   # - Buddy Requesting Driver

3) Ads
   #- Maybe put them on either side of Pills
   #- Maybe Put Text above Menu item(the ad), that puts it into their cart when clicked
   #- Maybe need to create a div for Ad that contains:
      #- Text
      #- Image
      #- Link to add_to_cart
   #- extra: Page for Different Message for Ad?
   #- Dynamically load Ads
   #- Unique ads in Ads Table?

#4) Requesting Employee Account
#   - Do we have to?

#7) Payment
   - Do we need to have checking for date range on Credit Card?   

#8) Maybe Remove Captain
#   - Captain doesnt need to do anything, Buddy is 'scheduled' when logged in

#9) Add User Zip Code
#   - Add search for restaurants/menu items based on Zip Code

10) Better Home Page

11) Add Classes, Tables for Objects, Functions?
   - Restaurant, with Resturant ID for Buddies
   - Food Items have Restaurant ID added
   - Current Moment, Restaurant is just restaurant Name: enough?
   - ...

12) More variables to menu item
   - Restaurant
#   - Zip
 
   # Same for Cart
#   - Zip
   - etc.

#13) Test Functionality for Buddies only seeing only their restaurant orders

# 14) Messages for Updates

# 15) Better Error Credit Card Page

#16) Need Not Verified Page
