# 1) If no Cart, need to alert empty cart
   # - at the current moment it is showing Chinese characters (probably object representation)

2) Order
   #- List of entrees
   # - Quantity 
   - If order has list of entrees, shows it as a list
      ex: ['wings', 'pizza', 'ranch']   
   - Need Address for Anonymous Ordering

#@ Need to Have Separate Logins
   # - Buddy Adding Menu Items
   # - Buddy Requesting Driver

3) Ads
   - Maybe put them on either side of Pills
   - Maybe Put Text above Menu item(the ad), that puts it into their cart when clicked
   - Maybe need to create a div for Ad that contains:
      - Text
      - Image
      - Link to add_to_cart

4) Requesting Employee Account
   - Do we have to?

7) Payment

8) Maybe Remove Captain
   - Captain doesnt need to do anything, Buddy is 'scheduled' when logged in

9) Add User Zip Code
   - Add search for restaurants/menu items based on Zip Code

10) Better Home Page

11) Add Classes, Tables for Objects, Functions?
   - Restaurant, with Resturant ID for Buddies
   - Food Items have Restaurant ID added
   - Current Moment, Restaurant is just restaurant Name: enough?
   - ...

12) More variables to menu item
   - Restaurant
   - Zip
 
   # Same for Cart
   - Zip
   - etc.

13) Hide app.secret_key

TODO for Project:
1) Fix Diagrams:
   - Object/Class Diagram: may be removing Captain
2) Fix Context + Diagram 0:
   - Proper Leveling (same input and outputs from Context to Diagram 0)
   - May be removing Captain

Random:
   - Github SSH push
